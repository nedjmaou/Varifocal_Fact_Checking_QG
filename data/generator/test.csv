They are an important part of our total intelligence collection capability. I don't know the specific facts of this case. We do know that Iran has been the place to which a number of al Qaeda members, including some of the leadership of al Qaeda, have fled in the aftermath of the war. So the fact that they are showing up in Iran is not surprising.  WOODRUFF: Senator, yet another report, this one in the New York Times that U.S. forces in Afghanistan working under the assumption that Osama bin Laden is still alive, that he's hiding out somewhere in the mountains between Pakistan and Afghanistan. What do you believe about where he is and in terms of how much information you have?  GRAHAM: What I believe is what I have been told by our intelligence agencies, which is that the best analysis is that bin Laden is probably still alive, living in that region between Afghanistan and the tribal territories of Pakistan, taking advantage of his knowledge of the territory and the support and sanctuary that he's able to receive from the residents in that very rugged, remote area.  WOODRUFF: And do you believe the U.S. military missed a major opportunity earlier to get rid of him?  GRAHAM: There's some speculation that in the battle of Tora Bora that we could have sealed off some of the mountain passes and maybe kept bin Laden inside. That is speculation, which at this point is without confirmation. One of the things, Judy ... that I think we need to be careful about. Bin Laden is an important figure. He brought charisma, money and a high intelligence to al Qaeda. But the really important institution is al Qaeda itself, and that our focus needs to be on dismantling al Qaeda so that it can no longer be the scourge that it was on September 11. I hope we get bin Laden. Knowing finally that he is either dead or in custody will make us sleep better at night. But that's not, by any means, the totality of our goal in Afghanistan and relative to al Qaeda.",,,What does Bob Graham think about al-Qaida?,http://www.cnn.com/2002/ALLPOLITICS/08/28/graham.access.cnna/

As Kevin Trenberth has discussed, all weather now occurs in a climate that humans have altered.  ""it is important to recognize that we have a “new normal,” whereby the environment in which all storms form is simply different than it was just a few decades ago.  Global climate change has contributed to the higher sea surface and sub-surface ocean temperatures, a warmer and moister atmosphere above the ocean, higher water levels around the globe, and perhaps more precipitation in storms.""  Two new papers have recently been published examining the link between global warming and hurricane intensity.  In both cases, the scientists have found evidence that the most intense hurricanes are already occurring more often as a result of human-caused global warming.

The assertion feeds into a subterranean narrative that Obama, with his exotic, mixed-race background, is not really American in the first place.  The claim that Obama is an apologist for America actually began to take shape shortly after he became president. It had been bubbling in the conservative blogs before Karl Rove, the former political adviser to George W.

This widespread belief is reflected in the fact that, until very recently, a ‘get tough’ mentality dominated American political discourse surrounding crime. From the 1970s well into the 21st century, politicians risked little by advocating for longer sentences and harsher penalties. In advocating for harsh punishments, these leaders generally assured the public that tougher sentences meant less crime.  But that turned out not to be the case. Plenty of people went to prison and for longer stretches. And starting in the early 1990’s, crime began a two decade long decline that the public seems by and large not to have noticed. Yet there’s little evidence to suggest that the threat of punishment—even the threat of very harsh punishment, such as the death penalty—is responsible for the drop in crime. A massive 2014 study undertaken by the National Research Council announced that one of its “most important conclusions is that the incremental deterrent effect of increases in lengthy prison sentences is modest at best.” Put in less academic-ese: Threatening people with increasingly harsh punishments doesn’t discourage crime.",,,harsher justice,https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/blog/ethics-in-question/201509/harsh-justice

The GDP growth rate is driven by the four components of GDP.1﻿ The main driver of GDP growth is personal consumption. This includes the critical sector of retail sales. The second component is business investment, including construction and inventory levels. Government spending is the third driver of growth. Its largest categories are Social Security benefits, defense spending, and Medicare benefits. The government often increases spending to jump-start the economy during a recession.

Good jobs. Employment statistics tell us what proportion of people have jobs. They don’t tell us what proportion of those with jobs are paid too little to afford a decent standard of living, or worry about whether they’ll still have work next month.  According to UK government figures, 94% of people were in work in 2014 – up nearly two percentage points in four years. However, the NEF calculated that only 61% were in secure jobs paying a living wage – down a similar amount in the same period.  2. Wellbeing. A growing economy is not an end in itself – it’s a means to improving people’s lives. Few would disagree that the ultimate aim of public policy is wellbeing; we care about GDP because we assume it means more wellbeing. So why not also measure wellbeing directly?  The validity of research into measuring wellbeing, by asking people about their life satisfaction, is now widely accepted. Such measures capture a range of things that people care about and that policies can influence – from income and health to housing and social connections.  Some governments do measure life satisfaction, including the UK (it increased from 7.4 to 7.6, on a scale of 0-10, in the four years to 2014). However, it remains at the margins of policymaking.  3. Environment. The NEF propose a national indicator of lifestyle-related carbon emissions, relative to an allocation calculated from global targets for avoiding dangerous levels of climate change.  In four years, the UK’s position deteriorated from using 91% of its allocation to 98%. As climate is a global problem, this indicator is effectively a measure of responsible global citizenship.  4) Fairness. Research increasingly shows that high income inequality has negative social consequences, while casting doubt on the idea that it incentivises hard work.  Comparing the average incomes of the top and bottom 10%, inequality in the UK has been worsening by an average of 0.8% a year for the last four years.  5) Health. The NEF proposes “avoidable deaths” as a simple, easily-understandable measure that captures the quality of health interventions – not only treatment, but also prevention.  Here, the UK shows a positive trend, but with plenty of room for further improvement – the latest figures suggest 23% of deaths need not have happened.",,,What other ways can you measure economic well-being?,https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2016/04/five-measures-of-growth-that-are-better-than-gdp

Go to: Abstract The aim of this paper is to provide a panoramic view of laws and policies on abortion around the world, giving a range of country-based examples. It shows that the plethora of convoluted laws and restrictions surrounding abortion do not make any legal or public health sense. What makes abortion safe is simple and irrefutable—when it is available on the woman’s request and is universally affordable and accessible. From this perspective, few existing laws are fit for purpose. However, the road to law reform is long and difficult. In order to achieve the right to safe abortion, advocates will need to study the political, health system, legal, juridical, and socio-cultural realities surrounding existing law and policy in their countries, and decide what kind of law they want (if any). The biggest challenge is to determine what is possible to achieve, build a critical mass of support, and work together with legal experts, parliamentarians, health professionals, and women themselves to change the law—so that everyone with an unwanted pregnancy who seeks an abortion can have it, as early as possible and as late as necessary.",,,What information is included in the policy that helps international health centers determine what constitutes actively promoting abortion?,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5473035/

Recommended for: Beginners looking to use CBD as a supplement boost to provide future medicinal benefits. It can be taken anytime throughout the day or night up to 3 times per day.  50 milligrams to 100 milligrams of CBD Taking this much CBD is often believed to be a good starting dose for those with mild to moderate pain or other symptoms that they’d like to relieve with edibles. It is enough to provide some relief while remaining low enough to reduce the chance of your edibles interfering with your quality of sleep, but it’s still best to keep this size of CBD edibles dosage to a minimum of 4 hours or more before bedtime.  Recommended for: Beginner consumers seeking relief from mild to moderate symptoms, and experienced users who have been unable to achieve results with lower doses. Take individual doses within this range no more than 3 times per day.  100 milligrams to 150 milligrams of CBD Ingesting this range worth of CBD edibles is a great starting point for consumers who are experiencing moderate to severe symptoms that require treatment, but it is a significant amount of the cannabinoid. That is why this high of a dose isn’t one that should be taken too frequently, especially by new consumers.  Recommended for: More experienced consumers who are suffering from difficult to manage symptoms that have been unresponsive to smaller doses of CBD edibles.  150 milligrams to 200 milligrams of CBD This is a relatively high dose of CBD and not recommended for new consumers, but those who seek a more intense relief without the help of THC may benefit most from CBD edibles that are within this range.  Recommended for: Experienced users only. While this is a relatively average dose that many patients might find themselves at, eventually, the transition should be a slow process to avoid any potential issues or side effects. Do not take before bed and no more than 3 times per day.  250 milligrams and up Anything higher than 150 milligrams is considered to be a high dose of CBD, and while the effects may not be psychoactive, there is always a possibility of experiencing adverse effects when ingesting CBD edibles that fall within this range.  Recommended for: Experienced and long term consumers who have been unable to achieve relief with lower doses tried over a period of at least 4-8 weeks.",,,"10 milligrams to 50 milligrams of CBD This is a very small dose of CBD and is an excellent starting point for less experienced consumers who aren’t seeking immediate relief from intense symptoms.

Recommended for: Experienced and long term consumers who have been unable to achieve relief with lower doses tried over a period of at least 4-8 weeks.  THC edibles dosage   iStock / Moussa81 It is highly recommended that new users begin with the lowest dose possible of 1-2.5 milligrams of THC and gradually increase their cannabis edibles dosages as they gain experience and familiarity with the effects. Cannabis edibles can be enjoyable, but they also have the potential to be much more potent and longer-lasting than traditional dried herb, making them the ultimate way of consuming THC but also the most notorious for producing a negative experience in those who weren’t fully aware of what to expect.  While we can’t predict precisely how one marijuana gummy or brownie will affect you, we can provide a helpful list of recommended guidelines to work within.  1 milligram to 2.5 milligrams of THC Ingesting such a small amount of THC will produce gentle effects, including improved focus, heightened creativity, and mild relief for those seeking relief from pain, anxiety or stress.  Recommended for: First-time users, occasional users, and those looking for pain relief without the intense high.  2.5 milligrams to 15 milligrams of THC Consuming a marijuana edible with this much THC content is expected to have a stronger effect on pain relief, but can also come with other sensations such as euphoria that may impair hand-eye coordination.  Recommended for: Casual and regular users as well as people seeking relief from chronic pain, or sleep problems.  15 milligrams to 30 milligrams of THC This range is considered a moderate dose and will likely result in an intense couch locking body and head high. This amount will likely impair hand-eye coordination, give a sense of euphoria, and may alter perception, which can be overwhelming to anyone with a low tolerance of THC.  Recommended for: Regular or chronic users of marijuana products who have already built a tolerance. Medical patients seeking intense pain relief, and those looking for help in managing sleep issues.  30 milligrams to 50 milligrams of THC This is a potent dose of THC and will produce powerful effects such as a strong feeling of euphoria or altered perception. This amount will impair a user’s ability to think clearly and will also interfere with hand-eye coordination. This amount will also get you stoned.  Recommended for: Seasoned long-term or regular users of marijuana products, those seeking intense or chronic pain relief and also anyone with a poor GI absorption, rendering cannabinoids less effective.  50 milligrams to 100 milligrams of THC This is the highest dosage recommended. No person should ingest more than 100 milligrams of THC at one time. Even at an amount of 50 milligrams to 100 milligrams, a marijuana edible has the potential to cause more adverse reactions to effects. Users may find the feeling to be overwhelming and negative. Consuming this much THC can cause other adverse effects such as rapid heart rate, nausea, headaches, and pain.  Recommended for: Only those who have a high tolerance and experience level with cannabis products or patients looking to alleviate symptoms of cancer, chronic pain, and other inflammatory conditions.",https://cannabis.wiki/guides/consumption/oral/dosage

Other researchers were unable to reproduce Wakefield's findings,[3][4] and a 2004 investigation by Sunday Times reporter Brian Deer identified undisclosed financial conflicts of interest on Wakefield's part.[5] Most of Wakefield's co-authors then withdrew their support for the study's interpretations.[6]  The British General Medical Council (GMC) conducted an inquiry into allegations of misconduct against Wakefield and two former colleagues,[7] focusing on Deer's findings.[8] In 2010, the GMC found that Wakefield had been dishonest in his research, had acted against his patients' best interests and mistreated developmentally delayed children,[9] and had ""failed in his duties as a responsible consultant"".[10][11][12] The Lancet fully retracted Wakefield's 1998 publication on the basis of the GMC's findings, noting that elements of the manuscript had been falsified and that the journal had been ""deceived"" by Wakefield.[13][14] Three months later, Wakefield was struck off the UK medical register, due in part to his deliberate falsification of research published in The Lancet,[15] and was barred from practising medicine in the UK.[16] In a related legal decision, a British court held that ""[t]here is now no respectable body of opinion which supports [Dr. Wakefield's] hypothesis, that MMR vaccine and autism/enterocolitis are causally linked"".[17]",,,British doctor fraudulant vaccines,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Wakefield

That would more than pay for the $1.5 trillion cost of the tax cuts themselves.   The U.S. Department of the Treasury looked at the combined effect of the tax cuts and Trump's Fiscal Year 2018 budget. The budget would boost growth through increased infrastructure spending, deregulation, and welfare reform.   Congress approved the budget and then some. Trump asked for $1.15 trillion in discretionary spending and Congress gave him $1.3 trillion. Congress also added $10.6 billion to Trump’s request for infrastructure spending, amounting to a total of $21 billion.   The Treasury report projected the tax cuts and the budget would boost economic growth to 2.9% a year for the next 10 years. That prosperity would boost tax revenue enough to offset the tax cuts.",,,How much does Trumps tax cuts cost?,https://www.thebalance.com/cost-of-trump-tax-cuts-4586645

Young adults make up a large percentage of these newly insured people.  Health insurance is more affordable for many people Insurance companies must now spend at least 80 percent of insurance premiums on medical care and improvements. The ACA also aims to prevent insurers from making unreasonable rate increases.  Insurance coverage isn’t free by any means, but people now have a wider range of coverage options.  People with preexisting health conditions can no longer be denied coverage A preexisting condition, such as cancer, made it difficult for many people to get health insurance before the ACA. Most insurance companies wouldn’t cover treatment for these conditions. They said this was because the illness or injury occurred before you were covered by their plans.  Under the ACA, you can’t be denied coverage because of a preexisting health problem.  No time limits exist on care Before the ACA, some people with chronic health problems ran out of insurance coverage. Insurance companies set limits on the amount of money they would spend on an individual consumer.  Insurance companies can no longer maintain a preset dollar limit on the coverage they provide their customers.  More screenings are covered The ACA covers many screenings and preventive services. These usually have low copays or deductibles. The hope is that if you’re proactive in your healthcare, you can avoid or delay major health problems later.  Healthier consumers will lead to lower costs over time. For example, a diabetes screening and early treatment may help prevent costly and debilitating treatment later.  “The ACA is going to help all Americans have higher quality and less costly healthcare in the decades to come,” says Dr. Christopher Lillis, an internist in Virginia and a member of Doctors for America.  Prescription drugs cost less The ACA promised to make prescription drugs more affordable. Many people, particularly senior citizens, are unable to afford all their medications. The number of prescription and generic drugs covered by the ACA is growing every year.  According to a Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services press release from 2017, Medicare beneficiaries have saved over $26.8 billion on prescription drugs under Obamacare.",,,What were the benefits of Obamacare?,https://www.healthline.com/health/consumer-healthcare-guide/pros-and-cons-obamacare#pros

The author is described as a senior official working for the administration of U.S. president Donald Trump. The op-ed criticizes Trump and states that many current members of the administration deliberately undermine his suggestions and orders for the good of the country. It also states that some cabinet members in the early days of the administration discussed using the Twenty-fifth Amendment to the United States Constitution as a way to remove the president from power.  The New York Times editorial board said that it knows the author's identity but granted the person anonymity to protect them from reprisal.[1][2] The publication of this editorial was unusual because few New York Times pieces have been anonymously written.[3] Trump expressed outrage and called for an investigation; the author's identity drew much speculation in the media, with over 30 senior administration officials denying their involvement.

In all countries worldwide, whether females increase schooling from 10 years to 11, say, or two years to three, infant mortality declines, according to a recent study by the Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation at the University of Washington.  Women with more education tend to have smaller families, in part because of increased employment opportunities and better knowledge about contraception; fewer children in a family improves the chances that an infant will survive. More education also helps women make better decisions about many health and disease factors such as prenatal care, basic hygiene, nutrition and immunization—which are vital to reducing the leading causes of death in children under five, shown below.  — Mark Fischetti  Cause of death	Percent of deaths Neonatal*	41 Other	16 Diarrhea	14 Pneumonia	14 Malaria	8 Injuries	3 HIV/AIDS	2 Measles	1",,,How does better education among women lower the mortality rate for their kids?,https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/graphic-science-female-education-reduces-infant-childhood-deaths/

Carried interest is generally tied to a specified rate of return known as a hurdle rate. If, for example, the fund's target return is 12% and it only earns 8%, the general partner might earn no carry or have their compensation from carried interest reduced or eliminated altogether depending upon the general partner's agreement with the fund.  A typical fund structure might pay the general partner an ongoing fee of 2% annually. The carried interest portion is where their big payoff lies, this might entail 20% of the fund's profits over a set time period like five years.  Carried interest usually vests over a period of years. Even if the fund's target return is met over the appropriate time period, a portion of the carried interest may be ""clawed back"" due to shortfalls in subsequent years.

Wade, allow states to impose more restrictions on post-viability abortions than during the earlier stages of pregnancy.  As of December 2014, forty-two states had bans on late-term abortions that were not facially unconstitutional under Roe v. Wade or enjoined by court order.[41] In addition, the Supreme Court in the case of Gonzales v. Carhart ruled that Congress may ban certain late-term abortion techniques, ""both previability and postviability"",[42] as it had done in banning intact dilation and extraction with the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act of 2003.[43]  The Supreme Court has held that bans must include exceptions for threats to the woman's life, physical health, and mental health, but four states allow late-term abortions only when the woman's life is at risk; four allow them when the woman's life or physical health is at risk, but use a definition of health that pro-choice organizations believe is impermissibly narrow.[41] Note that just because a portion of a state's law is found to be unconstitutional does not mean that the entire law will be deemed unconstitutional: ""[I]nvalidating the statute entirely is not always necessary or justified, for lower courts may be able to render narrower declaratory and injunctive relief,"" meaning the court could declare that only those parts of the law that are violative of the Constitution are invalid (declaratory relief), or that the court can prohibit the state from enforcing those portions of the law (injunctive relief).[44]  Eighteen states prohibit abortion after a certain number of weeks' gestation (usually 22 weeks from the last menstrual period).[41] The U.S. Supreme Court held in Webster v. Reproductive Health Services that a statute may create ""a presumption of viability"" after a certain number of weeks, in which case the physician must be given an opportunity to rebut the presumption by performing tests.[45] Because this provision is not explicitly written into these state laws, as it was in the Missouri law examined in Webster, pro-choice organizations believe that such a state law is unconstitutional, but only ""to the extent that it prohibits pre-viability abortions"".[46]  Ten states (although Florida's enforcement of such laws are under permanent injunction) require a second physician's approval before a late-term abortion can be performed.[41] The U.S. Supreme Court struck down a requirement of ""confirmation by two other physicians"" (rather than one other physician) because ""acquiescence by co-practitioners has no rational connection with a patient's needs and unduly infringes on the physician's right to practice"".[47] Pro-choice organizations, such as the Guttmacher Institute, posit that some of these state laws are unconstitutional, based on these and other Supreme Court rulings, at least to the extent that these state laws require approval of a second or third physician.[41]  Thirteen states have laws that require a second physician to be present during late-term abortion procedures in order to treat a fetus if born alive.",,,Which state prohibits abortions in the later months of a pregnancy except in very rare cases,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Late_termination_of_pregnancy

If ever there was a real ’red line’ in the region, this is it. Any ""limited” or “broad” military intervention in Syria is simply unacceptable to Syria, Iran, Russia, Hezbollah, China and a whole host of other nations that want to turn the page on US hegemonic aspirations in the region and beyond. Washington has miscalculated in thinking that an attack in any shape or form would be palatable to its quite incredulous adversaries. They are all intimately familiar with the slippery slope of American interventionism and its myriad unintended consequences. Israel, in particular, appears to be victim to a false sense of security. Analysts and commentators there seem to think that the lack of a Syrian military response to recent Israeli missile strikes is a trend likely to continue. Or that Hezbollah and Iran would have no ’grounds’ to climb aboard a counterattack if Syria were attacked. But the fact is that, to date, no member of the Resistance Axis has faced a collective western-Israeli-GCC effort to strike a blow at their core. This promised US-plus-allies strike against Syria makes their calculation aneasy one: there is nowhere to go but headfirst into the fracas. The US has never predicted outcomes successfully in the Middle East and is unlikely to do so this time given that its strategic and military objectives seem even more muddled than usual. What we do know is that Hezbollah Secretary-General Hassan Nasrallah has promised that the “next battle” will take place inside Israel’s borders and that he will fight proportionately this time – striking Israeli cities when Israel hits Lebanese ones. On the Syrian front, Israel imagines a war-weary adversary. But the Syrian armed forces have the kinds of conventional weapons and ballistic missiles that can level a town in short shrift – that is not an outcome Israel has the capacity to endure.",,,What would be the response and outcome of Syria being attacked?,https://www.voltairenet.org/article180158.html

Data sources include two national surveys of employer-based health plans and e-health insurance listings for individual coverage on the World Wide Web. Data on the use and cost of services are from the National Medical Expenditure Survey (NMES), a national household survey of Americans. We estimate that individual insurance pays on average 63 percent of the health care bill, whereas group health insurance pays 75 percent. Deductibles are much higher in individual insurance, and covered benefits are more meager. At 200 percent of poverty, the top 25 percent of health care users with individual coverage would spend 11 percent of their income for out-of-pocket health care expenses, as opposed to 6 percent for persons with group coverage.",,,"Based on the Kaiser Foundation's model, how much are insurance premiums for a 60 year-old with the same provisions as a 27 year old?",https://www.healthaffairs.org/doi/full/10.1377/hlthaff.W2.172

It is imperative to note that defunding the organization would not only be a threat to the health and well-being of women but would also have adverse economic repercussion to the society. The allegations that the organization engage in abortion and sale of fetal tissues are unfounded and uncalled for. There is no sufficient evidence to link the organization with such vices and hence denying millions of women their basic health needs based on such allegations would be unwise. Conservatives argue that the contraceptives used are form of abortions and abortion is equivalent to murder (Tanne 903-903).  This is self contradicting since any attempt to defund the organization would lead to increased cases of unwanted pregnancies and hence more abortions. It is therefore better to allow controlled birth since it does not entail abortion. It should also be note that the organization does not only offer the contraceptives but is also involved in cancer screening and testing of STDs. These are fundamental services to Americans and hence the campaign of defunding the organization should be brought to an end.",,,Who would suffer if taxpayers no longer supported Planned Parenthood,https://www.essaytyping.com/defunding-planned-parenthood/

Graham-Cassidy, however, allows states to obtain waivers from the later requirement — so, while insurers technically would not be able to deny coverage outright, they would be able to charge such exorbitant premiums that the insurance would be rendered unaffordable.  According to a Center for American Progress analysis, a 40-year-old with metastatic cancer would be hit with a surcharge of over $140,000. (Disclosure: ThinkProgress is an editorially independent news site housed at the Center for American Progress.)  The provision permitting such waivers, moreover, potentially allows insurers to raise premiums “as a condition of enrollment or continued enrollment under the plan.” Thus, Graham-Cassidy could allow an insurer to raise premiums to unaffordable levels the minute someone becomes sick, effectively cutting off their insurance the moment they need it.",,,Bill Cassidy child premiums,https://archive.thinkprogress.org/lies-cassidy-health-bill-3818f110e32b/

In spite of significant infrastructure improvements and technological innovations applied to border crossing and cargo inspection, the border crossing process for trucks crossing from Mexico into the U.S. remains complicated.  Besides filing shipment data with both Mexican and U.S. federal agencies, and facing potential physical inspections at three physical locations (Mexican Customs; U.S. Federal compound, and U.S. State safety inspection facility), Mexican truck shipments into the U.S. are required to use drayage or transfer tractor to cross the border. Typically, a shipper in Mexico uses drayage or transfer tractor to pick up a trailer on the Mexican side of the border and haul it into the U.S., where it is dropped off and picked up by a U.S. long-haul tractor that can carry the trailer further into U.S. territory [3].

On Monday, Warren cited and publicized analysis from Carlos Bustamante, a professor of genetics at Stanford and adviser to Ancestry and 23 and Me. ""While the vast majority of the individual's ancestry is European,"" he concluded of Warren, ""the results strongly support the existence of an unadmixed Native American ancestor in the individual's pedigree, likely in the range of 6-10 generations ago."" In short, the results pretty much agree with what Warren has been arguing for years. ""I am very proud of my heritage,"" she told NPR in 2012. ""These are my family stories. This is what my brothers and I were told by my mom and my dad, my mammaw and my pappaw. This is our lives. And I'm very proud of it."" In that account and others, a genealogist traced Warren's Native American heritage to the late 19th century.

Security requests are likely handled by career government employees.  • These types of requests are generally handled at a pretty low level.  • It would be a poor use of her time to decide security levels for all State properties.  • The primary request for security for the Benghazi villa was a note in February. It asked for FIVE DSG guards. That was to protect an estimated 3 State personnel.  As near as I can tell, the security profile was not met, because the villa was never staffed to that level.  • On the day of the attack there were FIVE DSG guards there, exactly the number requested.  • The Ambassador himself decided on his security detail.
