He explains that based on his first-hand experience in the White House, he has come to believe that “the job of the President is far more difficult than any other civil position in government.” And, he says, “I believe that it is vital that the President be able to focus on his never-ending tasks with as few distractions as possible.” Having to respond to civil litigation, discovery requests, deposition demands, questioning by prosecutors or even sitting through a trial, Kavanaugh believes, imposes an intolerable diversion of attention and energy on any sitting president.  Kavanaugh acknowledges the irony in his saying that – after all, he began his career working for Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr, helping to impose those exact burdens on President Bill Clinton. But “in retrospect,” he writes, “that seems a mistake.” Looking back to those times, he says, “the nation certainly would have been better off if President Clinton could have focused on Osama bin Laden without being distracted by the Paula Jones sexual harassment case and its criminal investigation offshoots.”  To be clear, Kavanaugh is not recommending that the president be completely immune from civil or criminal liability, only that the litigation be deferred until the president leaves office. If justice cannot be delayed that long, he writes, it should be up to Congress to step in and exercise its power of impeachment.",,,Kavanaugh's 2009 article,https://www.scotusblog.com/2018/07/kavanaugh-on-presidential-power-law-review-article-on-investigations-of-sitting-presidents/

Employment and labor regulations: Employment laws pertain to all aspects of working conditions, from wages and benefits to safety and health, from equal opportunity to privacy. Several regulations are broadly applied across the U.S., including the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), applied by the Wage and Hour Division, mandates minimum wages. The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) regulates retirement plan and health care benefits, and the Immigration and Nationality Act regulates citizen and work visa status of employees. Environmental regulation: The primary federal regulator on the environment in the U.S. is the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). The EPA enforces environmental laws and provides a compliance assistance program in the form of The Environmental Compliance Assistance Guide. The EPA enforces law through inspections, via local and state regulators as well as educational resources. Privacy regulation: Privacy laws prevent businesses from disclosing private or sensitive information freely. Types of protected information include personally identifiable information (PII) such as social security numbers, credit card and bank information, as well as health conditions. Personal health information is protected by a set of regulations called HIPAA and HITECH. Even inadvertent violations of privacy regulations in any jurisdiction can result in litigation and heavy penalties from regulatory bodies. Safety and health regulations: Perhaps the most widely applicable and well-known safety and health regulation is The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (U.S.C. title 29, chapter 15). OSHA�s main goal is to ensure that employers provide employees with an environment free from recognized hazards, such as exposure to toxic chemicals, excessive noise levels, mechanical dangers, heat or cold stress, or unsanitary conditions. The Act created two major regulatory agencies: The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) and the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH).",,,businesses regulation in USA,https://www.epiqglobal.com/en-us/thinking/class-action-mass-tort/faq/government-regulation-business-faq

The Internet Research Agency (IRA), based in Saint Petersburg and described as a troll farm, created thousands of social media accounts that purported to be Americans supporting radical political groups, and planned or promoted events in support of Trump and against Clinton; they reached millions of social media users between 2013 and 2017. Fabricated articles and disinformation were spread from Russian government-controlled media, and promoted on social media. Additionally, computer hackers affiliated with the Russian military intelligence service (GRU) infiltrated information systems of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC), and Clinton campaign officials, notably chairman John Podesta, and publicly released stolen files and emails through DCLeaks, Guccifer 2.0 and WikiLeaks during the election campaign. Finally, several individuals connected to Russia contacted various Trump campaign associates, offering business opportunities to the Trump Organization and damaging information on Clinton. Russian government officials have denied involvement in any of the hacks or leaks.  Russian interference activities triggered strong statements from American intelligence agencies, a direct warning by then-U.S. President Barack Obama to Russian President Vladimir Putin, renewed economic sanctions against Russia, closures of Russian diplomatic facilities and expulsion of their staff. The Senate and House Intelligence Committees conducted their own investigations into the matter. Trump denied the interference had occurred, contending that it was a ""hoax"" perpetrated by Democrats to explain Clinton's loss. He dismissed FBI Director James Comey in part over his investigation of Russian meddling.  Russian attempts to interfere in the election were first disclosed publicly by members of the United States Congress on September 22, 2016, confirmed by United States intelligence agencies on October 7, 2016, and further detailed by the Director of National Intelligence office in January 2017. According to U.S. intelligence agencies, the operation was ordered directly by Putin. The Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) opened the Crossfire Hurricane investigation of Russian interference on July 31, 2016, including a special focus on links between Trump associates and Russian officials and suspected coordination between the Trump campaign and the Russian government. The FBI's work was taken over in May 2017 by former FBI director Robert Mueller, who led a Special Counsel investigation until March 2019.[1] Mueller concluded that Russian interference was ""sweeping and systematic"" and ""violated U.S. criminal law"", and he indicted twenty-six Russian citizens and three Russian organizations. The investigation also led to indictments and convictions of Trump campaign officials and associated Americans, for unrelated charges. The Special Counsel's report, made public on April 18, 2019, examined numerous contacts between the Trump campaign and Russian officials but concluded that there was insufficient evidence to bring any conspiracy or coordination charges against Trump or his associates.",,,Foreign influence 2016 election,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_interference_in_the_2016_United_States_elections

There is a very fine line between ""hobby"" and ""mental illness.""      People who want to share their religious views with you almost never want you to share yours with them.      You should not confuse your career with your life.      Nobody cares if you can't dance well. Just get up and dance.      Never lick a steak knife!      The most destructive force in the universe is gossip.      You will never find anybody who can give you a clear and compelling reason why we observe daylight savings time.      You should never say anything to a woman that even remotely suggests that you think she's pregnant unless you can see an actual baby emerging from her at that moment.      There comes a time when you should stop expecting other people to make a big deal about your birthday. That time is age eleven.      The one thing that unites all human beings, regardless of age, gender, religion, economic status or ethnic background, is that, deep down inside, we ALL believe that we are above average drivers.      A person, who is nice to you, but rude to a waiter, is not a nice person. (This is very important. Pay attention. It never fails.)      Your friends love you anyway.

Last month, the Chief Medical Officer described the hospital death report (Health Care Quality Indicators in the Irish Health System: Examining the Potential of Hospital Discharge Data) as a �burglar alarm�, while not saying that you house has been ransacked, clearly it needs to be checked out.  Speaking in the Dail this evening (Tuesday) Denis Naughten said � while the Department of Health told the HSE to check out the alarm, both organisations continued to let is ring for another 30 months, before even opening the door of the house to see what was happening�.  �This is what has just happened with the recent admission by Mr. Ian Carter HSE�s National Director of Acute Services who was quoted as saying that the review of the death data was only �now happening on a hospital by hospital basis�.  �This admission is even more bizarre when in March 2012 Minister Reilly told the D�il that the reason why the report had not been published at that stage was because �the CMO, in conjunction with theHSE, is now in the process of further augmenting the analysis of the indicators to date with data for 2011 and 2012. Every public hospital in the country has been written to in order that they can ensure that the information they record and report for 2011 and 2012 is accurate�.  �It is important to remember that these figures were, we are told, setting off alarm bells within the Department of Health in July 2011, as per Minister Reilly�s comments in the D�il on Roscommon Hospital, yet even after the follow up with hospitals clarifying the figures; a number of hospitals were still well outside the norm, with some hospital with stroke death rates 4 times higher than others and heart attack death rates 7 times higher than the best performers. Yet amazingly there seems have been no follow through to see what was happening in the individual hospitals to cause such mortality rates.  �This revelation raises serious questions for James Reilly, the Department of Health & the HSE. Their failure to act particularly on the revised data not only exposes the dysfunctional nature of the relationship between the bodies but more importantly another example where those in charge of running our health service are failing to put patient interests ahead of institutional interests.",,,denis naughten death rate,https://denisnaughten.ie/2014/03/12/hospital-death-alarm-going-off-for-2-%C2%BD-years-naughten/

Here is a list of 25 FEMA Fire Management Assistance declarations and grants for the state of Texas since January 1, 2011: Texas FEMA fire grants 2011 From the Federal Emergency Management Agency  These FEMA grants for the state of Texas, whose Governor has flirted with the idea of seceding from the United States, cover 75 percent of the state�s costs for firefighting. The amount of federal money given to Texas for fires this year is not yet known, since the costs are still being incurred and the state has not submitted all of their claims for financial assistance to the federal government.  These grants are for specific incidents and are different from FEMA�s Major Disaster Declarations, one of which has not been approved for the Texas fires this year. Those are not awarded as often as the Fire Management Assistance grants, but Texas has received 16 of them since 2000. In fact, Texas has benefited more than any other state from federal Major Disaster Declarations.  Here is a list of the ten states that have had the most FEMA Major Disaster Declarations since 1953: FEMA top ten states major disaster declarations From the Federal Emergency Management Agency  We feel for the families of the two firefighters that died while fighting fires in Texas recently, and we have sympathy for the individuals that have lost property in the fires. But if and when Texas secedes from the United States as threatened and either forms their own country or becomes a Mexican state, they will have to find a new source for bailing them out of their costs for fires, floods, and hurricanes.  And perhaps, while asking other U.S. taxpayers for money, Texas should reconsider the bill that passed both houses of their legislature that cuts the funding of the Texas Forest Service�s Wildfire and Emergency Program by more than 30%.

It is a phrase that people must remember when considering “no tax increase” bond issues.  Bonds are one of the most common ways for school districts to fund construction of new buildings. They are essentially a loan and are a form of debt. To pay for this debt, school districts levy property taxes. Sometimes districts must levy new taxes to finance a bond and other times they are able to refinance an existing bond and hold the tax levy at the same rate. The latter often are labeled as “no tax increase” bond issues; but make no mistake, there is no such thing as “no tax increase” bond issue.  As I explain in this edition of ""Show-Me Now,"" a “no tax increase” bond issue is a lot like a home equity loan. Your mortgage company can refinance your loan to give you access to cash right now. Often, they are able to do this while holding your payment the same, but extending the length of your repayment. So instead of your payments ending in 10 years, they may be extended to 30 years. Whether you refinance or not, your monthly payment remains the same.  Bonds work in much the same way and school districts can “refinance” to extend the term of the bond. They market this to the public as a “no tax increase” bond issue and claim that your payment will not go down or up whether the issue passes or not. Your tax payment will not change, but you will be paying for a longer period of time.  There is no getting around it, paying the same rate for a longer period of time is a tax increase. Therefore, it is more appropriate to call these a “no tax levy increase” bond issue.",,,what will require no tax rate increase?,https://showmeinstitute.org/blog/taxes-income-earnings/myth-no-tax-increase-bond-issue

Temperatures in Southern California soared to record-high levels over the weekend, approaching 100 degrees in some places. Reservoirs are low. Landscapes are parched and blighted with fields of dead or dormant orange trees.  The apocalyptic scenario needs to be leavened with some basic facts.  California has plenty of water�just not enough to satisfy every possible use of water that people can imagine when the price is close to zero. As David Zetland points out in an excellent interview with Russ Roberts, people in San Diego county use around 150 gallons of water a day. Meanwhile in Sydney Australia, with a roughly comparable climate and standard of living, people use about half that amount. Trust me, no one in Sydney is going thirsty.  So how much are people in San Diego paying for their daily use of 150 gallons of water? About 78 cents. As Matt Kahn puts it:  Where in the Constitution does it say that the people of California have the right to pay .5 cents per gallon of water?  Water is such a small share of most people�s budgets that it could double in price and the effect on income would still be low. Moreover, we don�t even have to increase the price of water for residential or industrial uses. As The Economist points out:  Agriculture accounts for 80% of water consumption in California, for example, but only 2% of economic activity.",,,How was the shortage of water fixed in west texas in 2015?,https://marginalrevolution.com/marginalrevolution/2015/03/the-california-water-shortage-again.html

The Child Tax Credit (CTC) This tax benefit is worth up to $2,000 for each child. Eligibility for claiming the CTC depends on the status of your children. Starting in 2019, you can only claim the CTC if your qualifying children have Social Security Numbers. You and your spouse (if married) can have an ITIN or SSN.  To claim the CTC, you will enter your ITIN and your children�s SSNs on Schedule 8812 �Additional Child Tax Credit.� Qualifying children for the CTC must be either a U.S. citizen or a resident alien living in the U.S. (While children with ITINs living in Mexico or Canada can be a dependent for tax filing purposes, they cannot be claimed for the CTC.)  NEW: A $500 non-refundable credit is available for families with qualifying relatives. This includes children over 17 and children with an Individual Taxpayer Identification Number who otherwise qualify for the CTC. Additionally, qualifying relatives who are considered a dependent for tax purposes (like dependent parents), can be claimed for this credit. Since this credit is non-refundable, it can only help reduce taxes owed. If you are eligible for both this credit and the CTC, this will be applied first to lower your taxable income.  The SSN requirement for children expires in 2026 and CTC eligibility will revert to prior rules�the credit will be worth up to $1,000 per child, and you, your spouse, and your qualifying child can have an SSN or ITIN to claim the CTC using Schedule 8812. These rules also apply if you were eligible for the CTC and didn�t claim it in 2018, 2017, or 2016.  2. The American Opportunity Tax Credit (AOTC) This credit is worth up to $2,500 and can help reduce educational expenses to attend college.
