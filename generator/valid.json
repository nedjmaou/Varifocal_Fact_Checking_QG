But giving Pence something to do might turn out to be a win-win for Trump.

Waiting in the wings for such an exigency is Nikki Haley; as a former ambassador to the United Nations, state legislator and governor, she\u2019s compiled a sterling resume. With Haley on the ticket, Trump can hope to draw in millions of women who otherwise would vote for a mixed-gender Democratic ticket.

Trump said that cutting taxes will increase growth enough to offset the loss of revenue. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut income taxes and lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%. But Trump's tax cuts will cost the government by increasing the debt. Trump's reliance on supply-side economic theory won't work. The Laffer curve says that tax rates must be in the prohibitive zone, above 50%, to work.  Trump promised to grow the economy by 6% annually to increase tax revenues. That would be too fast for healthy economic growth. It would create inflation, a boom-bust cycle, and then a crash. His tax plan forecasts a 3% growth rate.

There are many options to look into which we will cover in this article, the most popular of which is The Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP). CHIP provides health care coverage to millions of low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid.   The future of CHIP has been a topic of concern, however, in January 2018 Congress passed an extension for CHIP for 4 years, followed by a second extension of an additional 6 years in February 2018, allowing the continuation of the CHIP program for at least another decade. While funding for the program is still at risk, proposed cuts to the program have not yet been passed by Congress. Medicaid and CHIP coverage combined cover 36 million children, of which CHIP covers health care for approximately 6 million children.   These two combined programs help families access health care for their children and have brought the uninsured rate of children in America to al all-time low.

{"input": "answer: Then, in 2014, Pence signed into law a withdrawal from Common Core and promised a quick turnaround for new school standards, \"written by hoosiers, for hoosiers.\"  That's because under Gov. Pence, the growth in the number of charter schools and the use of private school vouchers have exploded. After the voucher program survived a state Supreme Court challenge in 2013, it's grown into one of the largest in the country.  Pence helped to do that by advocating to expand the program to include middle-income, not just low-income families, and also by removing the cap on how many students qualify.  During the last budget session, Pence tried to push the Republican-dominated Legislature to pass an additional $1,500-per-student allocation to charters in order to pay for non-academic expenses, like transportation. But the measure was eventually scaled back to $500 per student.   Eventually he negotiated the On My Way Pre-K pilot program. Over the past two years, it's provided scholarships for nearly 2,300 low-income 3- and 4-year-olds.

{"input": "answer: SUMMARYAmerica\u2019s foreign and security challenges today are vastly different from what they were during the Cold War. The broad goals of U.S. assistance programs have long been to assist people in crises, enhance market opportunities for American products and investments by catalyzing economic growth in developing countries, and promote U.S. national security and foreign policy by supporting allies and countering adversaries. These are worthy goals. But like any long-term effort, U.S. foreign assistance needs periodic assessment, re-evaluation, and re-orientation to update concepts and priorities, eliminate duplication and waste, and address changing circumstances. For instance, official development assistance from Western governments used to be the primary source of investment for developing countries, but is now dwarfed by private capital flows, and this change needs to be reflected in America\u2019s development assistance programs.

{"input": "answer: For starters, Johnson's legislation would increase the full retirement age from 67, which is the current expectation of people born in 1960 and after, to 69 years of age by 2030. It would reduce cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for higher-earning individuals, while at the same time increasing benefits at a faster pace for lower-income retirees. In particular, individuals earning in excess of $85,000 and couples with more than $170,000 in earnings would have their COLAs completely cut out beginning in December 2018. The chained Consumer Price Index (CPI) would be used to calculate COLA increases for all other workers instead of the currently used CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Johnson's legislation would begin phasing out the taxation of Social Security benefits beginning in 2045 and ending by 2054. Currently, Social Security taxes a percentage of benefits if an individual earns more than $25,000 annually, or a couple earns more than $32,000. By 2053, the phased taxable limits would rise to $92,500 for an individual and $185,000 for couples. By 2054, this tax would be eliminated in its entirety. The bill would place a cap on the benefit amount for spouses and children of higher-earning retired and disabled individuals. It would eliminate the retirement earnings test, which applies only to people receiving benefits before hitting their full retirement age (FRA). In 2017, the Social Security Administration can withhold $1 in benefits for every $2 in wages earned above $16,920, and $1 in benefits for every $3 in wages earned above $44,880 if you'll hit your FRA in 2017 and are already receiving benefits. The earnings test would disappear by 2023, giving elderly working Americans the ability to double-dip with their wages and Social Security benefits.

Coal production continues to climb even with fewer miners. \"Production has gone very high compared to the old days,\" Attfield says. \"When you're producing a lot of coal, you're making a lot of dust.\"  Not only is there more dust, but those miners also are working longer hours, he says. If they're working a 12-hour shift instead of an 8-hour shift, he says, that's 50 percent more coal dust.

Orlando Police Department officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff.  In a 9-1-1 call made shortly after the shooting began, Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and said the U.S. killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq the previous month \"triggered\" the shooting. He later told a negotiator he was \"out here right now\" because of the American-led interventions in Iraq and in Syria and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing. The incident was deemed a terrorist attack by FBI investigators.  Pulse was hosting a \"Latin Night\", and most of the victims were Hispanic.

{"input": "answer: For law enforcement purposes, the use of riot control agents \u2013 i.e., \u2018tear gas\u2019 \u2013 is permitted. In the view of the ICRC, the Chemical Weapons Convention, the Biological and Toxin Weapons Convention, international human rights law, and international drug control law form an overlapping international legal framework that leaves little room, if any, for the legitimate use of toxic chemicals other than riot control agents as weapons for law enforcement.\u201d  The upshot of the ICRC analysis is that tear gas can be used only as a \u201criot control agent.\u201d But what we have seen in Sudan are not riots but peaceful demonstrations, turned violent by the actions of the al-Bashir regime\u2019s security forces.

The Convention does, however, limit use to \u201cthe types and quantities [that] areconsistent with such purposes.\u201d (Article II.2, Chemical Weapons Convention).\u201d  I would argue that particularly the quantities of tear gas, as used by Khartoum\u2019s security forces, are grossly inconsistent with any reasonable law enforcement purposes, and thus violate Article II.2 of the Chemical Weapons Convention\u2014ER  Finally, it is important to under that international human rights law (IHRL) extends to a \u201cbroad range of circumstances where the use of ICA weapons or RCAs might be considered.\u201d Thus the Khartoum regime\u2019s excessive use of tear gas for purposes that have nothing to do with law enforcement\u2014and everything to do with suppressing lawful demonstrations\u2014comes within the ambit of IHRL:  context: Says of tear gas use against migrants, Is this legal?

Large amounts of tear gas have been used in densely populated cities, including Cairo, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Manama (Bahrain), and Hong Kong. In the United States, tear gas was used extensively during recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Whereas tear gas deployment systems have rapidly improved\u2014with aerial drone systems tested and requested by law enforcement\u2014epidemiological and mechanistic research have lagged behind and have received little attention. Case studies and recent epidemiological studies revealed that tear gas agents can cause lung, cutaneous, and ocular injuries, with individuals affected by chronic morbidities at high risk for complications. Mechanistic studies identified the ion channels TRPV1 and TRPA1 as targets of capsaicin in pepper spray, and of the tear gas agents chloroacetophenone, CS, and CR.

{"input": "answer: In the largest sense, the government funds a substantial and diverse range of programs and activities, from Pell Grants to scientific research to military operations. The overwhelming majority of federal spending (in terms of the dollars disbursed) consists of \u201cmandatory spending,\u201d sometimes called entitlements. In mandatory funded programs (like Social Security and Medicare), legislation defines the eligibility criteria for participation, and the government allocates funds to all who are eligible, regardless of the annual cost to the Treasury.   The other category of funding is known as \u201cdiscretionary spending.\u201d Nearly all federal funding that reaches colleges and universities comes through discretionary programs, though the largest student aid program, Pell Grants, combines both mandatory and discretionary funding streams. Discretionary-funded programs have annual allocations that set the total level of funding they can provide within that fiscal year.   A final category of funding of interest to campuses is federal student loans. Student loans have terms set through legislation and are dispersed directly to institutions on behalf of student borrowers, who are then obligated to repay the Treasury under the terms of their individual loan. In this way, federal student loans work somewhat like an entitlement program in that the government does not set an annual loan amount to provide, and the terms of the loans and students\u2019 ability to borrow are set in law.   The funding process is an annual event. Congress is tasked with producing a budget resolution and 12 appropriations bills for each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Other funding legislation, such as emergency funding in response to a natural disaster, frequently occurs outside of the standard process.  Both the House and Senate set their own rules for how funding bills are handled, but the impact on federal revenue (known as the \u201cscore\u201d) is determined by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO is also responsible for determining the baseline data used to assess the fiscal standing of the government under various criteria. This baseline data is used primarily to project future deficits or surpluses, but also to project the impact of legislation on federal revenues. The most frequently used baseline is a calculation of future federal spending, deficit, and debt under the assumption that all current law remains unchanged.  context: U.S. Sen.

{"input": "answer: Consistent with expectations, there was a significant negative association between state background checks and firearms homicides. Analyses of the condition indices for this model found that it suffered from a very severe multicollinearity, and elevated variance inflation factors. Independent examination of the variables suggested that the element that contributed most significantly to these collinear results was the rate of persons under correctional super- vision. Consequently, the number of violent offenses was used as an indicator of active offenders in Models 2 through 5. This substitution theoretically might be more appropriate because the violent crime rate more closely reflected the true number of offenders\u2014rather than those persons on proba- tion or parole who might desist from crime. Moreover, citizen fear of crime (and the hypothesized increase in firearms density) was more likely to be driven by reports of crime, rather than the size of the probation or parole population.  context: Background checks have been unequivocally shown to reduce gun violence.", "output": "What are the statistics that were used to measure that gun violence is down since background checks were established?"}

Developing countries have forked out over $4.2tn in interest payments alone since 1980 \u2013 a direct cash transfer to big banks in New York and London, on a scale that dwarfs the aid that they received during the same period. Another big contributor is the income that foreigners make on their investments in developing countries and then repatriate back home. Think of all the profits that BP extracts from Nigeria\u2019s oil reserves, for example, or that Anglo-American pulls out of South Africa\u2019s gold mines.  But by far the biggest chunk of outflows has to do with unrecorded \u2013 and usually illicit \u2013 capital flight. GFI calculates that developing countries have lost a total of $13.4tn through unrecorded capital flight since 1980.  Most of these unrecorded outflows take place through the international trade system. Basically, corporations \u2013 foreign and domestic alike \u2013 report false prices on their trade invoices in order to spirit money out of developing countries directly into tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, a practice known as \u201ctrade misinvoicing\u201d. Usually the goal is to evade taxes, but sometimes this practice is used to launder money or circumvent capital controls.

{"input": "answer: 1. Ohio River The Ohio River is distinguished as one of the most polluted rivers in the US. Industrial waste is the main problem, with AK Steel Corporation as the main offender. Fisherman have been warned about the high mercury levels in the fish.  2. Mississippi River The brown color of the Mississippi River is caused by sediment and is the reason this large mass of water is often referred to as the Big Muddy. Fertilizer contaminants in the Mississippi are responsible for a dead zone of 6000 to 8000 square miles located where the river runs into the Gulf of Mexico.  3. Tennessee River In a study, 121 people from the area were tested and shown to have elevated PFOA levels in the blood. A lawsuit was filed against corporate polluters of the Tennessee River. There is little doubt that the health of the four million people drinking this water has been compromised. Health risks related to thyroid disease, cancer, immune system problems and ulcerative colitis increase with the pollutants present in the Tennessee River.  4. Cuyahoga River The Cuyahoga River is so polluted that it has caught fire on several occasions. Running through Ohio, this river inspired the passage of the Clean Water Act passed in 1972. This river is full of industrial waste is one of the most polluted rivers in the US.  5. Holston River Another Tennessee river makes the list of most polluted rivers in the US. Holston River is seriously polluted with toxic chemicals. The Holston Army Ammunition Plant is the chief source of contaminants. Specifically, the carcinogen, Research Development Explosive (RDX) was dumped from the plant into the river.  6.

{"input": "answer: Examine your rock samples for the presence of a fusion crust. The thin crust looks black, but years after the meteorite has fallen to Earth, the crust begins to wear away. Check the inside of the rock if it is exposed. A bumpy, irregular feature known as a regmaglypt may appear on the surface or interior of some meteorites. Iron meteorites often have these regmaglypts all over their surface.  Test the density of the rock. Meteorites almost always contain metal, specifically iron. You could easily find nonextraterrestrial, metal-containing rocks or iron slugs on Earth, however. Meteorites have a unique quality because the iron also contains about 7 percent nickel. Meteorites also have a higher density than Earth rocks. You can compare two rocks of similar size. One should be the rock you suspect is a meteorite. Calculate the density of the rocks. First, weigh each rock on the balance. Record the results. Using a measuring cup or container, fill the container halfway. Make a note of how many ounces of water you put in. Now immerse the first rock. Make a note of the water level on the measuring cup. The difference between the first and second measurements is the volume. Divide the weight that you measured by volume you just calculated to get the density. Compare your results with the density of known Earth rocks. A stone meteorite typically has a density of 3.5 grams per milliliter, while an iron meteorite has a density of 8.0 grams per milliliter.  context: Was a Rock Used as a Doorstep Actually a Valuable Meteorite?", "output": "What is the difference between a rock found on Earth and a meteorite?"}

Casey Foundation and Georgia governor\u2019s office, students who score below grade level on third-grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10.

{"input": "answer: Three ways to reduce the trade deficit are:  Consume less and save more. If US households or the government reduce consumption (businesses save more than they spend), imports will drop and less borrowing from abroad will be needed to pay for consumption. This means that consumption taxes\u2014like those that nearly all other countries in the world have\u2014could help reduce the deficit, by discouraging consumption, increasing saving, and reducing the government deficit. In contrast, an unfunded tax cut, such as the one proposed by the administration, will expand the deficit because the government will be consuming more relative to its earnings. Depreciate the exchange rate. Trade deficit reversals are typically driven by a significant real exchange rate depreciation. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive and exports cheaper and improves the trade balance. Given the dollar is the world's reserve currency, and still regarded as the safest for investors, it tends to run stronger than other currencies. But when foreign governments actively push the dollar up to maintain their surpluses, the United States could counteract intervention by selling dollars and buying foreign currencies. The administration could also encourage the adoption of other major currencies, such as the euro, yen, or renminbi, as alternative reserve currencies. A weaker dollar would be good for the US economy, but relinquishing the role as the dominant currency would reduce the power of the United States in global markets and the seigniorage (profit) earned. Tax capital inflows. One of the reasons that the United States runs a trade deficit is because borrowing from abroad is cheap and easy. If it were more expensive, US citizens and the government would borrow less. A tax on (non\u2013foreign direct investment) capital inflows that rises with the size of the inflow could reduce excessive borrowing for consumption and help close the government imbalance. While some worry that capital controls could distort asset prices and reduce investment, they could also curb excessive speculative investment, such as happened before the financial crisis.  context: Our trade deficit in goods reached nearly \u2026 $800 billion last year alone.", "output": "What can be done to lower the trade deficit?"}

{"input": "answer: Chapter 41 of the Texas Education Code (TEC) makes provisions for certain school districts to share their local tax revenue with other school districts.

Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough.", "output": "Why did the United States not sign the Paris Agreement?"}
{"input": "answer: How does the withdrawal decision impact China? First, global warming will be intensified after the U.S. withdraws from the Paris Agreement, putting China under greater ecological vulnerability and climate risks. China is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to climate change, and U.S. withdrawal from the agreement is a heavy blow to global efforts against climate change\u2014it will make the consequences of global warming more disastrous, and as a result, China's ecological vulnerability and climate risk will increase markedly.  Second, U.S. withdrawal from the agreement will diminish China's emission space and raise China's mitigation costs. The global computable general equilibrium model (Dai et al., 2017) predicts that 1) under the NDCs target, if the U.S. only reduces its emissions by 20%, 13%, and 0% below the 2005 levels by 2025, the CO2 emissions space will decrease by 0.8%, 1.6%, and 3.2% in China in the year 2030. Under the 2 \u00b0C target, if the U.S. only reduces its emissions by 20%, 13%, and 0% below the 2005 levels by 2025, it will decrease CO2 emissions space by 1.7%, 2.8%, and 5.0% in China in 2030. 2) In that year, under the NDCs target if the U.S. only reduces its emissions by 20%, 13%, and 0% below the 2005 levels by 2025, the carbon price will rise by 1.1\u20134.6 US$ t\u22121 in China; under the 2 \u00b0C target, the carbon price will rise by 4.4\u201314.6 US$ t\u22121. 3) In 2030, under the NDCs target, the additional GDP loss will be US$ 4.75\u201319.77 billion (per capita GDP loss of US$ 3.5\u201314.8) in China; under the 2 \u00b0C target, the additional GDP loss will be US$ 21.98\u201371.1 billion (per capita GDP loss of US$ 16.4\u201353.1).  Third, the importance of climate cooperation has been considerably diminished in the Sino\u2013U.S. relationship. Xi and Obama made serious headway in prioritizing climate change as the highlight of their bilateral agenda, and to a certain extent, climate cooperation enhances mutual trust between the two. But the issue of climate change did not come up at either the Xi-Tillerson meeting on 19 March, 2017, or the Xi\u2013Trump meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2017. This sharp contrast between the Obama and Trump Administrations suggests that climate change no longer has a foundational role.  Fourth, China will reinforce its existing dominance in the clean energy sector. China and the U.S. were neck and neck in clean energy capacity in 2007, producing 148,446 MW and 107,917 MW, respectively, and those figures changed to 545,206 MW and 214,766 MW in 2016 (IRENA, 2017), also respectively. Many U.S. scholars are worried that the U.S. will fall further behind China in the race to develop renewable energy if it retreats on climate efforts (Sivaram and Saha, 2017).  Fifth, China faces mounting pressure to redefine its role in global climate governance, and America's sudden renouncement of climate leadership departs strikingly from its joint efforts with China underlying the Paris Agreement, leading the world to pin its hopes on China.  context: Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement.

The indictment also indicates the hackers poked around in counties in Georgia, Florida and Iowa.

This study examines the numerical interpretation of 20 verbal probability expressions by 55 auditors employed in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore by determining the minimum numerical threshold they assign to verbal probability expressions used in accounting standards. The study seeks to assess the degree of between-group consensus about the numerical interpretation of these expressions.  The findings indicate that the numerical interpretation of one expression \"virtually certain\" is sensitive to cross-national differences and that the two expressions \"probable\" and \"more likely than not\" are not numerically interpreted as synonyms. Furthermore, the results indicate that the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) should use caution when developing accounting standards using verbal probability expressions.

Walker ran for Governor of Wisconsin in 2006, but dropped out of the race before the primary election. He ran again in 2010 and won.

As with many exaggerated reports from Sweden in foreign right-wing outlets, the tone of the reporting implies there has been a large crime wave brought about by the recent migration crisis. This is misleading.  Refugees who arrived during the migration crisis are too few in number to explain much of Swedish crime trends. Sweden\u2019s crime-heavy immigrant neighborhoods emerged gradually through the accumulated effects of many decades of immigration.  Several types of crimes such as gang shooting, arson, and sexual assault have increased in Sweden, but other categories such as assault, car thefts, and property crimes have decreased. The increase in sexual assault and violent crime is not as spectacular a development as the Fox News segment made it out to be. Even in Swedish immigrant enclaves, criminality is still fairly mild compared with U.S. crime hubs.

House Democratic leaders are eyeing a Tuesday vote on the bill, eager to have it signed into law before they depart for a 10-day July Fourth recess, according to lawmakers and aides.

There are countless complex reasons someone might decide to get an abortion after 20 weeks. It is, according to those who\u2019ve made that choice, something you can never fully understand until it\u2019s happened to you.
