Mike Pence and Donald Turmp President Trump speaks at the White House news conference on Feb. 26 in which he announced Vice President Mike Pence would be leading the administration’s response to the coronavirus outbreak. (AFP/Getty Images) MARCH 1, 20203 AM To the editor: Sure, naming Vice President Mike Pence, a science-disdaining evangelical Christian, to coordinate our country’s response to the looming coronavirus epidemic may seem like yet another inapt Trumpian appointment. But giving Pence something to do might turn out to be a win-win for Trump.  If the virus’ spread somehow is thwarted under Pence’s direction, Trump can cite this stunning success all the way to election day. If an epidemic ensues, Trump can tell Pence he’s fired and replace him with a more appealing running mate.  Waiting in the wings for such an exigency is Nikki Haley; as a former ambassador to the United Nations, state legislator and governor, she’s compiled a sterling resume. With Haley on the ticket, Trump can hope to draw in millions of women who otherwise would vote for a mixed-gender Democratic ticket.  Democrats have every reason to pray that Pence doesn’t falter in his epidemic-fighting role.   Edward Alston, Santa Maria  ..  To the editor: The president, in order to manage the spin on the COVID-19 virus and make sure to maintain the very best of images, has decided that any medical information from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention meant for American citizens must first get the blessing of the vice president, who has no medical training.  There’s a name for this kind of governance -- it’s called “dictatorship.”  ADVERTISEMENT Ellen Faulk, Santa Monica  ..

His first term is from 2017 to 2021. Trump's economic plan focuses on ""making America great again."" He negotiated ""the biggest deal of my life"" with those voters who felt they had lost the American Dream. Trump's policies follow economic nationalism.   ""America First"" Energy Plan On June 1, 2017, Trump announced the U.S. withdrawal from the Paris Climate Agreement.1﻿ The 195 signatories had pledged to cut their greenhouse-gas emissions to a level that's 26% to 28% below 2005 levels by 2025. They agreed to ratchet emissions to zero by 2100.

He demonstrated this ability in his campaign by using Twitter instead of an expensive PR campaign.24﻿ He emphasized cost containment in his book ""The Art of the Deal."" But his debt reduction plan adds $5.3 trillion to the nation's debt.  Trump said that cutting taxes will increase growth enough to offset the loss of revenue. The 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act cut income taxes and lowered the corporate tax rate to 21%. But Trump's tax cuts will cost the government by increasing the debt. Trump's reliance on supply-side economic theory won't work. The Laffer curve says that tax rates must be in the prohibitive zone, above 50%, to work.  Trump promised to grow the economy by 6% annually to increase tax revenues. That would be too fast for healthy economic growth. It would create inflation, a boom-bust cycle, and then a crash. His tax plan forecasts a 3% growth rate. He also said he could continue to ""borrow knowing that if the economy crashed, you could make a deal. The U.S. will never default because you can print the money.""25﻿ These are the most dangerous statements Trump has ever uttered.26﻿ The first one is a blatant falsehood. If the economy collapsed, there would be no one to make a deal with. It would send the dollar into a collapse. That would send the entire world into another Great Depression. Printing money would send the dollar back into decline. Interest rates would rise as creditors lost faith in U.S. Treasurys.

CHIP provides health care coverage to millions of low-income children who do not qualify for Medicaid.   The future of CHIP has been a topic of concern, however, in January 2018 Congress passed an extension for CHIP for 4 years, followed by a second extension of an additional 6 years in February 2018, allowing the continuation of the CHIP program for at least another decade. While funding for the program is still at risk, proposed cuts to the program have not yet been passed by Congress. Medicaid and CHIP coverage combined cover 36 million children, of which CHIP covers health care for approximately 6 million children.   These two combined programs help families access health care for their children and have brought the uninsured rate of children in America to al all-time low.

After the voucher program survived a state Supreme Court challenge in 2013, it's grown into one of the largest in the country.  Pence helped to do that by advocating to expand the program to include middle-income, not just low-income families, and also by removing the cap on how many students qualify.  During the last budget session, Pence tried to push the Republican-dominated Legislature to pass an additional $1,500-per-student allocation to charters in order to pay for non-academic expenses, like transportation. But the measure was eventually scaled back to $500 per student.   Eventually he negotiated the On My Way Pre-K pilot program. Over the past two years, it's provided scholarships for nearly 2,300 low-income 3- and 4-year-olds.

The broad goals of U.S. assistance programs have long been to assist people in crises, enhance market opportunities for American products and investments by catalyzing economic growth in developing countries, and promote U.S. national security and foreign policy by supporting allies and countering adversaries. These are worthy goals. But like any long-term effort, U.S. foreign assistance needs periodic assessment, re-evaluation, and re-orientation to update concepts and priorities, eliminate duplication and waste, and address changing circumstances. For instance, official development assistance from Western governments used to be the primary source of investment for developing countries, but is now dwarfed by private capital flows, and this change needs to be reflected in America’s development assistance programs. Fundamental reform has languished for far too long and, as a result, many U.S. foreign aid programs are no longer fit to effectively help countries in need or to serve U.S. interests.",,,Which source can track that foreign aid for agricultural research will bring trade with the United States?,https://www.heritage.org/global-politics/report/overhaul-americas-foreign-assistance-programs-long-overdue

My policy would put them in jail.” In 2002 he said, “I support killing people who declare war on our country, just as I was prepared to kill people personally & collectively in Vietnam.” Kerry still opposes the death penalty in other cases.

It would reduce cost-of-living adjustments (COLAs) for higher-earning individuals, while at the same time increasing benefits at a faster pace for lower-income retirees. In particular, individuals earning in excess of $85,000 and couples with more than $170,000 in earnings would have their COLAs completely cut out beginning in December 2018. The chained Consumer Price Index (CPI) would be used to calculate COLA increases for all other workers instead of the currently used CPI for Urban Wage Earners and Clerical Workers (CPI-W). Johnson's legislation would begin phasing out the taxation of Social Security benefits beginning in 2045 and ending by 2054. Currently, Social Security taxes a percentage of benefits if an individual earns more than $25,000 annually, or a couple earns more than $32,000. By 2053, the phased taxable limits would rise to $92,500 for an individual and $185,000 for couples. By 2054, this tax would be eliminated in its entirety. The bill would place a cap on the benefit amount for spouses and children of higher-earning retired and disabled individuals. It would eliminate the retirement earnings test, which applies only to people receiving benefits before hitting their full retirement age (FRA). In 2017, the Social Security Administration can withhold $1 in benefits for every $2 in wages earned above $16,920, and $1 in benefits for every $3 in wages earned above $44,880 if you'll hit your FRA in 2017 and are already receiving benefits. The earnings test would disappear by 2023, giving elderly working Americans the ability to double-dip with their wages and Social Security benefits.

Orlando Police Department officers shot and killed him after a three-hour standoff.  In a 9-1-1 call made shortly after the shooting began, Mateen swore allegiance to the leader of the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, and said the U.S. killing of Abu Waheeb in Iraq the previous month ""triggered"" the shooting. He later told a negotiator he was ""out here right now"" because of the American-led interventions in Iraq and in Syria and that the negotiator should tell the United States to stop the bombing. The incident was deemed a terrorist attack by FBI investigators.  Pulse was hosting a ""Latin Night"", and most of the victims were Hispanic. It is the deadliest incident in the history of violence against LGBT people in the United States and the deadliest terrorist attack in the U.S. since the September 11 attacks in 2001.

Svendsen, 3 and Sven‐Eric Jordtcorresponding author 2 Author information Article notes Copyright and License information Disclaimer This article has been cited by other articles in PMC. Go to: Abstract Deployments of tear gas and pepper spray have rapidly increased worldwide. Large amounts of tear gas have been used in densely populated cities, including Cairo, Istanbul, Rio de Janeiro, Manama (Bahrain), and Hong Kong. In the United States, tear gas was used extensively during recent riots in Ferguson, Missouri. Whereas tear gas deployment systems have rapidly improved—with aerial drone systems tested and requested by law enforcement—epidemiological and mechanistic research have lagged behind and have received little attention.

Johnny Isakson has voted for $7 trillion of our national debt!,Mostly True,Allen Buckley,8/10/16,What is the difference between raising the debt ceiling and enabling new spending programs?,"In the largest sense, the government funds a substantial and diverse range of programs and activities, from Pell Grants to scientific research to military operations. The overwhelming majority of federal spending (in terms of the dollars disbursed) consists of “mandatory spending,” sometimes called entitlements. In mandatory funded programs (like Social Security and Medicare), legislation defines the eligibility criteria for participation, and the government allocates funds to all who are eligible, regardless of the annual cost to the Treasury.   The other category of funding is known as “discretionary spending.” Nearly all federal funding that reaches colleges and universities comes through discretionary programs, though the largest student aid program, Pell Grants, combines both mandatory and discretionary funding streams. Discretionary-funded programs have annual allocations that set the total level of funding they can provide within that fiscal year.   A final category of funding of interest to campuses is federal student loans. Student loans have terms set through legislation and are dispersed directly to institutions on behalf of student borrowers, who are then obligated to repay the Treasury under the terms of their individual loan. In this way, federal student loans work somewhat like an entitlement program in that the government does not set an annual loan amount to provide, and the terms of the loans and students’ ability to borrow are set in law.   The funding process is an annual event. Congress is tasked with producing a budget resolution and 12 appropriations bills for each federal fiscal year, which begins on October 1. Other funding legislation, such as emergency funding in response to a natural disaster, frequently occurs outside of the standard process.  Both the House and Senate set their own rules for how funding bills are handled, but the impact on federal revenue (known as the “score”) is determined by the Congressional Budget Office (CBO). The CBO is also responsible for determining the baseline data used to assess the fiscal standing of the government under various criteria. This baseline data is used primarily to project future deficits or surpluses, but also to project the impact of legislation on federal revenues. The most frequently used baseline is a calculation of future federal spending, deficit, and debt under the assumption that all current law remains unchanged.",,,What is the difference between raising the debt ceiling and enabling new spending programs?,https://www.acenet.edu/Policy-Advocacy/Pages/Budget-Appropriations/Brief-Guide-to-Budget-Appropriations.aspx

Analyses of the condition indices for this model found that it suffered from a very severe multicollinearity, and elevated variance inflation factors. Independent examination of the variables suggested that the element that contributed most significantly to these collinear results was the rate of persons under correctional super- vision. Consequently, the number of violent offenses was used as an indicator of active offenders in Models 2 through 5. This substitution theoretically might be more appropriate because the violent crime rate more closely reflected the true number of offenders—rather than those persons on proba- tion or parole who might desist from crime. Moreover, citizen fear of crime (and the hypothesized increase in firearms density) was more likely to be driven by reports of crime, rather than the size of the probation or parole population.",,,What are the statistics that were used to measure that gun violence is down since background checks were established?,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222085810_State_background_checks_and_firearms_homicides

Developing countries have forked out over $4.2tn in interest payments alone since 1980 – a direct cash transfer to big banks in New York and London, on a scale that dwarfs the aid that they received during the same period. Another big contributor is the income that foreigners make on their investments in developing countries and then repatriate back home. Think of all the profits that BP extracts from Nigeria’s oil reserves, for example, or that Anglo-American pulls out of South Africa’s gold mines.  But by far the biggest chunk of outflows has to do with unrecorded – and usually illicit – capital flight. GFI calculates that developing countries have lost a total of $13.4tn through unrecorded capital flight since 1980.  Most of these unrecorded outflows take place through the international trade system. Basically, corporations – foreign and domestic alike – report false prices on their trade invoices in order to spirit money out of developing countries directly into tax havens and secrecy jurisdictions, a practice known as “trade misinvoicing”. Usually the goal is to evade taxes, but sometimes this practice is used to launder money or circumvent capital controls. In 2012, developing countries lost $700bn through trade misinvoicing, which outstripped aid receipts that year by a factor of five.",,,What is a large focus of health based aid received in lesser developed countries?,https://www.theguardian.com/global-development-professionals-network/2017/jan/14/aid-in-reverse-how-poor-countries-develop-rich-countries

Human trafficking– involves transporting, recruiting or harbouring people for the purpose of exploitation, using violence, threats or coercion. Descent-based slavery – where people are born into slavery because their ancestors were captured and enslaved; they remain in slavery by descent. Child slavery – many people often confuse child slavery with child labour, but it is much worse. Whilst child labour is harmful for children and hinders their education and development, child slavery occurs when a child is exploited for someone else’s gain. It can include child trafficking, child soldiers, child marriage and child domestic slavery. Forced and early marriage – when someone is married against their will and cannot leave the marriage.

People representing oil, agriculture, business, Chamber of Commerce, food processing. … Plus, we have environmentalists. ...”  Diverse, bipartisan interests working together to pass climate legislation — it was the polar opposite of Washington, where the Trump administration was rolling back environmental protections established under President Barack Obama.  Brown called California’s cap-and-trade program an answer to the “existential” crisis of climate change, the most reasonable way to manage the state’s massive output of greenhouse gasses while preserving its economy, which is powered by fossil fuels. “You can’t just say overnight, ‘OK, we’re not going to have oil anymore,’” he said.  But there are growing concerns with California’s much-admired, much-imitated program, with implications that stretch far beyond the state.",,,What does cap-and-trade legislation limit?,https://www.propublica.org/article/cap-and-trade-is-supposed-to-solve-climate-change-but-oil-and-gas-company-emissions-are-up

He believes the recount effort – and multimillion-dollar fundraising goal – led by Green Party candidate Jill Stein is nothing more than a scam.  Stein and her party are raising money for presidential recounts in Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Hillary Clinton’s campaign has offered help, but Clinton’s own lead counsel admitted that the recount won’t likely lead to any changes in the outcome of the presidential election.  Stein started the push for a recount last week. Since then, she has raised more than $6 million toward an effort neither she nor her party can guarantee will actually happen. A closer look at the fine print on her website says “we can only pledge we will demand recounts in WI and MI and support the voter-initiated effort in PA.”  She adds, “If we raise more than what’s needed, the surplus will also go toward election integrity efforts and to promote voting system reform. This is what we did with our surplus in 2004.”  She does not go into specifics about what those “election integrity efforts” might be.  Stein’s initial $2.5 million fundraising goal was surpassed in less than 48 hours. Since then, she’s upped her target to $4.5 million, but language on her donation page said the cost could go even higher. With attorneys' fees factored in, the total cost is likely to be $6 million to $7 million.  That’s a lot of money for the Green Party, especially considering Stein’s entire 2016 presidential campaign brought in $3,509,477 from donors.  “This is ridiculous,” Reince Priebus, former head of the Republican National Committee and incoming chief of staff for Trump, said on “Fox News Sunday.” “I think the American people know this is a waste of everybody’s time and money.

Ohio River The Ohio River is distinguished as one of the most polluted rivers in the US. Industrial waste is the main problem, with AK Steel Corporation as the main offender. Fisherman have been warned about the high mercury levels in the fish.  2. Mississippi River The brown color of the Mississippi River is caused by sediment and is the reason this large mass of water is often referred to as the Big Muddy. Fertilizer contaminants in the Mississippi are responsible for a dead zone of 6000 to 8000 square miles located where the river runs into the Gulf of Mexico.  3. Tennessee River In a study, 121 people from the area were tested and shown to have elevated PFOA levels in the blood. A lawsuit was filed against corporate polluters of the Tennessee River. There is little doubt that the health of the four million people drinking this water has been compromised. Health risks related to thyroid disease, cancer, immune system problems and ulcerative colitis increase with the pollutants present in the Tennessee River.  4. Cuyahoga River The Cuyahoga River is so polluted that it has caught fire on several occasions. Running through Ohio, this river inspired the passage of the Clean Water Act passed in 1972. This river is full of industrial waste is one of the most polluted rivers in the US.  5. Holston River Another Tennessee river makes the list of most polluted rivers in the US. Holston River is seriously polluted with toxic chemicals. The Holston Army Ammunition Plant is the chief source of contaminants. Specifically, the carcinogen, Research Development Explosive (RDX) was dumped from the plant into the river.  6. Harpeth River The appearance of deformed fish with both female and male reproductive organs have been found in the Harpeth River. Sewage waste and the runoff of stormwater create algal blooms which encourages a toxic environment for water life. Host to over 50 different fish species, Harpeth River’s pollution is particularly alarming.  7. New River The stench from New River is unmistakable and points to the high level of pollution in the water. This river flows into California from Mexico. Pollutants from industrial dumps and agricultural runoff contain mercury, pet waste, DDT, arsenic, and PCBs. The pollutants are so dangerous that technicians who work on the river have to wear protective equipment as a precaution.",,,What are the most polluted rivers in the US?,https://theearthproject.com/most-polluted-rivers-in-the-us/

The thin crust looks black, but years after the meteorite has fallen to Earth, the crust begins to wear away. Check the inside of the rock if it is exposed. A bumpy, irregular feature known as a regmaglypt may appear on the surface or interior of some meteorites. Iron meteorites often have these regmaglypts all over their surface.  Test the density of the rock. Meteorites almost always contain metal, specifically iron. You could easily find nonextraterrestrial, metal-containing rocks or iron slugs on Earth, however. Meteorites have a unique quality because the iron also contains about 7 percent nickel. Meteorites also have a higher density than Earth rocks. You can compare two rocks of similar size. One should be the rock you suspect is a meteorite. Calculate the density of the rocks. First, weigh each rock on the balance. Record the results. Using a measuring cup or container, fill the container halfway. Make a note of how many ounces of water you put in. Now immerse the first rock. Make a note of the water level on the measuring cup. The difference between the first and second measurements is the volume. Divide the weight that you measured by volume you just calculated to get the density. Compare your results with the density of known Earth rocks. A stone meteorite typically has a density of 3.5 grams per milliliter, while an iron meteorite has a density of 8.0 grams per milliliter.",,,What is the difference between a rock found on Earth and a meteorite?,https://sciencing.com/tell-rock-meteorite-5882702.html

As noted in the Chicago study, and backed up by the Annie E. Casey Foundation and Georgia governor’s office, students who score below grade level on third-grade reading tests are less likely to graduate. Then, there are studies that show high school dropouts are more likely to go to prison. A study from Northeastern University showed that a man with a high school degree had a 1 in 33 chance of incarceration. For a high school dropout, that rate rose to 1 in 10.  So, the Greene campaign argues, students who read below grade level in third grade tend not to graduate high school, and people who don’t graduate high school tend to have higher incarceration rates.",,,studies between third grade reading and prison,https://www.nbc-2.com/story/38872622/fact-check-jeff-greene-says-3rd-grade-reading-stats-reflect-if-floridians-go-to-college

The purpose driving these changes was to make it more difficult for people to obtain a gun and easier for law enforcement personnel to take guns away from known criminals and people who are deemed dangerous.  Here is a summary of three recent changes:  The waiting period to purchase a rifle has been increased from 24 hours to 72 hours between the time you purchased the gun and when you could take possession of it. Gun owners are required to obtain a Firearm Owner’s Identification Card (FOID) which must be renewed in a process that can be quite lengthy. The 2019 amendment ensures that an expired FOID card will remain valid as long as the renewal application was submitted prior to expiration – this prevent gun owners from being charged with unlawful use of a firearm while waiting to receive their new FOID card in the mail. The Firearms Restraining Order Act was signed into law in July 2018 and went into effect January 1, 2019. This law allows Courts to issue a 6-month Emergency Order of Protection that can be processed and issued the same day, enabling the Court to temporarily revoke an alleged dangerous person’s FOID card and firearms on an emergency basis.",,,What are the gun laws in Chicago,http://www.feldmancriminaldefense.com/gun-laws-in-chicago/

If US households or the government reduce consumption (businesses save more than they spend), imports will drop and less borrowing from abroad will be needed to pay for consumption. This means that consumption taxes—like those that nearly all other countries in the world have—could help reduce the deficit, by discouraging consumption, increasing saving, and reducing the government deficit. In contrast, an unfunded tax cut, such as the one proposed by the administration, will expand the deficit because the government will be consuming more relative to its earnings. Depreciate the exchange rate. Trade deficit reversals are typically driven by a significant real exchange rate depreciation. A weaker dollar makes imports more expensive and exports cheaper and improves the trade balance. Given the dollar is the world's reserve currency, and still regarded as the safest for investors, it tends to run stronger than other currencies. But when foreign governments actively push the dollar up to maintain their surpluses, the United States could counteract intervention by selling dollars and buying foreign currencies. The administration could also encourage the adoption of other major currencies, such as the euro, yen, or renminbi, as alternative reserve currencies. A weaker dollar would be good for the US economy, but relinquishing the role as the dominant currency would reduce the power of the United States in global markets and the seigniorage (profit) earned. Tax capital inflows. One of the reasons that the United States runs a trade deficit is because borrowing from abroad is cheap and easy. If it were more expensive, US citizens and the government would borrow less. A tax on (non–foreign direct investment) capital inflows that rises with the size of the inflow could reduce excessive borrowing for consumption and help close the government imbalance. While some worry that capital controls could distort asset prices and reduce investment, they could also curb excessive speculative investment, such as happened before the financial crisis.",,,What can be done to lower the trade deficit,https://www.piie.com/blogs/trade-and-investment-policy-watch/three-ways-reduce-trade-deficit

6/1/17,https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/statements/2017/jun/01/debbie-wasserman-schultz/are-nicaragua-and-syria-only-countries-not-sign-pa/,PolitiFact,Syria and Nicaragua are the only nations that didn't sign the Paris Agreement. Nicaragua said it wasn't tough enough.,TRUE,Debbie Wasserman Schultz,6/1/17,What are the impacts of the United States refusing to sign the PA?,"How does the withdrawal decision impact China? First, global warming will be intensified after the U.S. withdraws from the Paris Agreement, putting China under greater ecological vulnerability and climate risks. China is one of the countries that is most vulnerable to climate change, and U.S. withdrawal from the agreement is a heavy blow to global efforts against climate change—it will make the consequences of global warming more disastrous, and as a result, China's ecological vulnerability and climate risk will increase markedly.  Second, U.S. withdrawal from the agreement will diminish China's emission space and raise China's mitigation costs. The global computable general equilibrium model (Dai et al., 2017) predicts that 1) under the NDCs target, if the U.S. only reduces its emissions by 20%, 13%, and 0% below the 2005 levels by 2025, the CO2 emissions space will decrease by 0.8%, 1.6%, and 3.2% in China in the year 2030. Under the 2 °C target, if the U.S. only reduces its emissions by 20%, 13%, and 0% below the 2005 levels by 2025, it will decrease CO2 emissions space by 1.7%, 2.8%, and 5.0% in China in 2030. 2) In that year, under the NDCs target if the U.S. only reduces its emissions by 20%, 13%, and 0% below the 2005 levels by 2025, the carbon price will rise by 1.1–4.6 US$ t−1 in China; under the 2 °C target, the carbon price will rise by 4.4–14.6 US$ t−1. 3) In 2030, under the NDCs target, the additional GDP loss will be US$ 4.75–19.77 billion (per capita GDP loss of US$ 3.5–14.8) in China; under the 2 °C target, the additional GDP loss will be US$ 21.98–71.1 billion (per capita GDP loss of US$ 16.4–53.1).  Third, the importance of climate cooperation has been considerably diminished in the Sino–U.S. relationship. Xi and Obama made serious headway in prioritizing climate change as the highlight of their bilateral agenda, and to a certain extent, climate cooperation enhances mutual trust between the two. But the issue of climate change did not come up at either the Xi-Tillerson meeting on 19 March, 2017, or the Xi–Trump meeting at Mar-a-Lago in April 2017. This sharp contrast between the Obama and Trump Administrations suggests that climate change no longer has a foundational role.  Fourth, China will reinforce its existing dominance in the clean energy sector. China and the U.S. were neck and neck in clean energy capacity in 2007, producing 148,446 MW and 107,917 MW, respectively, and those figures changed to 545,206 MW and 214,766 MW in 2016 (IRENA, 2017), also respectively. Many U.S. scholars are worried that the U.S. will fall further behind China in the race to develop renewable energy if it retreats on climate efforts (Sivaram and Saha, 2017).  Fifth, China faces mounting pressure to redefine its role in global climate governance, and America's sudden renouncement of climate leadership departs strikingly from its joint efforts with China underlying the Paris Agreement, leading the world to pin its hopes on China.",,,What are the impacts of the United States refusing to sign the PA?,https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1674927817301028

There are plenty of signs that Russia shaped how Americans perceived the election. That’s why Kathleen Hall Jamieson, director of the Annenberg Public Policy Center at the University of Pennsylvania, calls the foreign actors “discourse saboteurs” in her latest book, Cyberwar: How Russian Hackers and Trolls Helped Elect a President. The Russians not only injected divisive rhetoric into the public narrative via troll accounts on social media, Jamieson says, but also by stealing troves of email from the Democratic National Committee and top Democrats like Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and then getting them amplified via mainstream media sources.",,,What did the Mueller report find on Russian Interference?,https://time.com/5573537/mueller-report-russia-election-interference/

This study examines the numerical interpretation of 20 verbal probability expressions by 55 auditors employed in Hong Kong, Malaysia and Singapore by determining the minimum numerical threshold they assign to verbal probability expressions used in accounting standards. The study seeks to assess the degree of between-group consensus about the numerical interpretation of these expressions.  The findings indicate that the numerical interpretation of one expression ""virtually certain"" is sensitive to cross-national differences and that the two expressions ""probable"" and ""more likely than not"" are not numerically interpreted as synonyms. Furthermore, the results indicate that the International Accounting Standards Committee (IASC) should use caution when developing accounting standards using verbal probability expressions.

METHODS: We reviewed the police, medical examiner, emergency medical service, emergency department, and hospital records of all fatal and nonfatal shootings in three U.S. cities: Memphis, Tennessee; Seattle, Washington; and Galveston, Texas.  RESULTS: During the study interval (12 months in Memphis, 18 months in Seattle, and Galveston) 626 shootings occurred in or around a residence. This total included 54 unintentional shootings, 118 attempted or completed suicides, and 438 assaults/homicides. Thirteen shootings were legally justifiable or an act of self-defense, including three that involved law enforcement officers acting in the line of duty.

He was elected to the Wisconsin State Assembly in 1992, representing a district in western Milwaukee County. In 2002, Walker was elected Milwaukee County Executive in a special election following the resignation of F. Thomas Ament; he was elected to a full term in 2004 and was re-elected in 2008.  Walker ran for Governor of Wisconsin in 2006, but dropped out of the race before the primary election. He ran again in 2010 and won. Shortly after his inauguration in 2011, Walker gained national attention by introducing the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill; the legislation proposed to limit collective bargaining for most Wisconsin public employees. In response, opponents of the bill protested at the Wisconsin State Capitol and Senate Democrats left the state in an effort to prevent the bill from being passed. Nevertheless, the Wisconsin Budget Repair Bill became law in March 2011. Opposition to the law led to an attempt to recall Walker from office in 2012. Walker prevailed in the recall election, becoming the first incumbent governor in the history of the United States to win a recall election.  Walker was re-elected in 2014, defeating Democratic Madison School Board member Mary Burke. For a brief period in 2015, after much speculation about possible frontrunner status, Walker was a candidate for his party's nomination in the 2016 presidential election. Walker sought a third term as governor in 2018, but was defeated by Democrat Tony Evers.",,,What events did Scott Walker attend that included an approved list?,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scott_Walker_%28politician%29

On Sunday morning, President Donald Trump got on the phone with Mayor Bill de Blasio to discuss what New York City needs to survive a white-hot outbreak that is only getting worse. De Blasio asked him to send more ventilators and military personnel, warning that in a week’s time, the health-care system could be overwhelmed.    Sign up for The Atlantic’s daily newsletter.

Yet with these particular leaders at this particular point in history, it is remarkable. Until recently, de Blasio told me, none of his calls to the upper reaches of the White House were returned. Two weeks ago, the Democratic mayor said publicly that Trump was “betraying” his native city by not sending more life-saving medical equipment. Ever sensitive to criticism, Trump said, in turn: “I’m not dealing with him.”  Defeating a pandemic is hard enough, but Trump has introduced another layer of complexity: He has personalized the battlefield. He calls COVID-19 “the invisible enemy,” but he also seems fixated on the visible variety—all Democratic leaders, who in his view have been insufficiently grateful for the federal government’s response. A stray complaint about equipment shortages invites a public feud with the man controlling the spigot. “If they don’t treat you right, I don’t call,” the president said at a news conference last week.",,,What is Trumps usual pattern when talking about something he wants to spin as positive?,https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2020/03/trump-democratic-governors-cuomo/609124/

As with many exaggerated reports from Sweden in foreign right-wing outlets, the tone of the reporting implies there has been a large crime wave brought about by the recent migration crisis. This is misleading.  Refugees who arrived during the migration crisis are too few in number to explain much of Swedish crime trends. Sweden’s crime-heavy immigrant neighborhoods emerged gradually through the accumulated effects of many decades of immigration.  Several types of crimes such as gang shooting, arson, and sexual assault have increased in Sweden, but other categories such as assault, car thefts, and property crimes have decreased. The increase in sexual assault and violent crime is not as spectacular a development as the Fox News segment made it out to be. Even in Swedish immigrant enclaves, criminality is still fairly mild compared with U.S. crime hubs. Last year the famously multicultural Swedish city of Malmö had a homicide rate of 3 per 100,000, far lower than the 28 per 100,000 rate in Chicago.",,,Crime Rate Sweden immigration,https://www.nationalreview.com/2017/02/sweden-crime-rates-statistics-immigration-trump-fox-news/

The 27-page bill differs from the version the Senate approved in committee this week by including extra oversight demands and giving hundreds of millions of dollars less to Immigration and Customs Enforcement. But Democratic spending leaders contend the broad elements of the bills are similar, improving prospects for a bipartisan compromise before the Department of Homeland Security and Health and Human Services completely deplete resources in the coming weeks.  House Democratic leaders are eyeing a Tuesday vote on the bill, eager to have it signed into law before they depart for a 10-day July Fourth recess, according to lawmakers and aides.  But the funding package will be a tough sell for many in the Democratic caucus who are still seething over the president’s defiance of Congress on immigration policy and on construction of a border wall, even as he seeks a $4.5 billion infusion to support the very agencies carrying out those directives.",,,How many Democrat House members voted in favor of the border fencing plan spending package in 2018?,https://www.politico.com/story/2019/06/21/house-democrats-border-aid-package-1548900

Only one percent of procedures take place this far along, which makes sense — abortion is more dangerous, more invasive, and far more expensive after this point. The choice to end a pregnancy after 20 weeks is often one borne of desperate circumstances: Many fatal fetal abnormalities can’t be detected until that point, and women who terminate later for nonmedical reasons are more likely to be young, unemployed, and to live far from abortion clinics; substance abuse, depression, and intimate-partner violence can also be factors.  There are countless complex reasons someone might decide to get an abortion after 20 weeks. It is, according to those who’ve made that choice, something you can never fully understand until it’s happened to you. To get a better understanding of what’s really at stake in this debate, the Cut spoke to four women who had later abortions. Some felt conflicted afterwards; others simply felt relieved. But what they all had in common was a firm conviction that they’re the only ones who know what’s best for their bodies and their families, that this isn’t something that can be neatly legislated or moralized about, and that putting arbitrary restrictions around the ability to access reproductive health care is barbaric and inhumane.",,,Why can't abortions be performed after 24 weeks?,https://www.thecut.com/2019/02/abortion-after-20-weeks-womens-stories.html
